# # M5 Agentic AI - Market Research Team
# 
# ## 1. Introduction
# 
# ### 1.1. Lab Overview  
# 
# In this lab, you will step into the role of a **technical AI lead at a fashion brand** preparing a summer sunglasses campaign. Your task is to design a **fully automated creative pipeline** that mirrors a real-world business scenario. Instead of handling each piece manually, you will guide a system that scans online sources for emerging fashion trends, matches those trends with sunglasses in the internal catalog, designs a campaign visual, generates a short marketing quote, and finally packages everything into an **executive-ready report**.  
# 
# The goal is to experience how multiple agents, tools, and models can be orchestrated into a single, coherent workflow. By the end of this lab, you will have built a pipeline that feels less like a script of isolated steps and more like a small team working together to solve a creative challenge.  
# 
# ### 1.2. 🎯 Learning outcome
# 
# By completing this lab, you will see how to move beyond single-turn interactions with a model and instead design **multi-agent pipelines** that coordinate planning, research, and creative generation. You will learn how to ground agent reasoning in external tools so that outputs are not just imaginative but also supported by real data. You will also experiment with reflection and packaging steps that enforce quality control and prepare results for an executive audience.  
# 
# In short, this lab is about learning how to combine the **imagination of large language models** with the **discipline of structured workflows**, giving you a practical pattern for building autonomous systems that are both creative and reliable.  

# ## 2. Setup: Import libraries and load environment
# 
# As in previous labs, you now import the required libraries, load environment variables, and set up helper utilities.

# In[4]:

# --- Standard library ---
import base64

import os

from datetime import datetime
from io import BytesIO

# --- Third-party ---

client = aisuite.Client()


# ## 3. Available Tools  
# 
# Agentic pipelines only become effective when the model is given **explicit capabilities** beyond its base reasoning. Declaring these tools upfront makes the agent’s action space unambiguous, ensures that prompts naturally guide tool selection, and keeps orchestration and testing transparent through well-defined interfaces.  
# 
# You will assemble a **marketing research team**, a group of specialized agents collaborating to design a summer sunglasses campaign. To empower them, we start by defining the tools that will ground their reasoning in real data.  
# 
# The first tool is `tools.tavily_search_tool`, which performs live web searches to uncover evidence of current fashion trends. Try it now by running a simple query for *“trends in sunglasses fashion”*:  

# In[5]:


tools.tavily_search_tool('trends in sunglasses fashion')


# The second tool is `tools.product_catalog_tool`, which returns the internal sunglasses catalog. Each entry includes details such as product name, ID, description, stock quantity, and price. This structured data will allow the agents to connect online fashion trends with actual items in stock:

# In[6]:


tools.product_catalog_tool()


# With these tools in place, you’ve defined a clear action space and reliable data sources. In the next section, you’ll build the agents that use them to turn raw fashion signals into structured insights and campaign assets.

# ## 4. Agent Definitions — Building Your Team
# 
# Now that you have defined the tools, it’s time to put them to work. In this phase, you will assemble a **marketing research team**, a group of specialized agents that you direct with natural instructions.  
# 
# Each agent relies on the tools you introduced earlier, and together they transform raw trend data into a polished campaign report.  We will define them one by one, introducing their role and showing the code that implements each.  

# ### 4.1. Market Research Agent  
# 
# With the **Market Research Agent**, you take the first step in building your campaign.  You ask it to scan the web with `tavily_search_tool` and uncover what’s trending in sunglasses fashion right now. Then you direct it to cross-check those signals against your internal catalog using `product_catalog_tool`, so you know which of your products fit the moment.  
# 
# The agent hands back a concise brief: the top fashion insights it found, the products that align with them, and a short explanation of why those picks make sense for your summer push. This gives you a clear, data-driven foundation to shape the rest of the campaign.  
# 
# You can now run the following cell to define the **Market Research Agent** in code.  

# In[7]:


def market_research_agent(return_messages: bool = False):

    utils.log_agent_title_html("Market Research Agent", "🕵️‍♂️")

You are a fashion market research agent tasked with preparing a trend analysis for a summer sunglasses campaign.

Your goal:
1. Explore current fashion trends related to sunglasses using web search.
2. Review the internal product catalog to identify items that align with those trends.
3. Recommend one or more products from the catalog that best match emerging trends.
4. If needed, today date is {datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")}.

You can call the following tools:
- tavily_search_tool: to discover external web trends.
- product_catalog_tool: to inspect the internal sunglasses catalog.

Once your analysis is complete, summarize:
- The top 2–3 trends you found.
- The product(s) from the catalog that fit these trends.
- A justification of why they are a good fit for the summer campaign.

# Next, you’ll turn this brief into a visual concept with the Graphic Designer Agent.

# ### 4.2. Graphic Designer Agent  
# 
# With the **Graphic Designer Agent**, you move from analysis to creativity.  
# You take the brief from your Market Research Agent and ask this one to translate it into a visual concept.  
# Because `aisuite` does not yet support direct image generation (like DALL·E), you guide the process in two stages:  
# 
# 1. First, the agent uses `aisuite` with an OpenAI text model (`o4-mini`) to craft a vivid **prompt** and a short, engaging **caption**.  
# 2. Then, the prompt is sent to OpenAI’s `dall-e-3` API to generate the **campaign image** itself.  
# 
# The result gives you everything you need to move forward: the generated image (saved locally for reuse), the exact prompt that produced it (useful for iteration), and a polished caption for campaign storytelling.  
#

#   <strong>Note:</strong> At this point, <code>aisuite</code> does <strong>not support direct image generation</strong>.  
#   That’s why you combine its text-based output (prompt + caption) with OpenAI’s <code>dall-e-3</code> to produce the final campaign visual.

# 
# By completing this lab, you have seen how to:  
# 
# - Use **multi-agent LLM pipelines** to automate a creative workflow end-to-end.  
# - Combine **reasoning, tool-calling, and external data** to ground your outputs in reality.  
# - Apply multimodal models (like `gpt-4o`) that process **both text and images** for tasks such as generating campaign quotes.  
# - Extend the model’s abilities with tools (`tavily_search_tool`, `product_catalog_tool`) so your outputs are not only imaginative but also practical.  
# - Keep execution **transparent and debuggable** with structured logging and HTML-styled blocks.  
# - Deliver a polished, **executive-ready report** in Markdown format that blends insights, visuals, and justifications into a single artifact.
