    "### 1.1. Lab Overview  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will step into the role of a **technical AI lead at a fashion brand** preparing a summer sunglasses campaign. Your task is to design a **fully automated creative pipeline** that mirrors a real-world business scenario. Instead of handling each piece manually, you will guide a system that scans online sources for emerging fashion trends, matches those trends with sunglasses in the internal catalog, designs a campaign visual, generates a short marketing quote, and finally packages everything into an **executive-ready report**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to experience how multiple agents, tools, and models can be orchestrated into a single, coherent workflow. By the end of this lab, you will have built a pipeline that feels less like a script of isolated steps and more like a small team working together to solve a creative challenge.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. 🎯 Learning outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this lab, you will see how to move beyond single-turn interactions with a model and instead design **multi-agent pipelines** that coordinate planning, research, and creative generation. You will learn how to ground agent reasoning in external tools so that outputs are not just imaginative but also supported by real data. You will also experiment with reflection and packaging steps that enforce quality control and prepare results for an executive audience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, this lab is about learning how to combine the **imagination of large language models** with the **discipline of structured workflows**, giving you a practical pattern for building autonomous systems that are both creative and reliable.  "

On the left, an athletic model sprints on a sunlit track in neon performance wear, wearing SG004 “Sport” wraparound shield sunglasses with a single curved lens, reflective blue tint and rubberized grips that catch golden rays. In the center, a glamorous model poses on a vintage-inspired Hollywood terrace at dusk, dressed in sculpted acetate and wearing SG003 “Mystique” cat-eye sunglasses with upswept corners and jeweled temples in rose-gold. On the right, a minimalist model stands on a rooftop at sunset against a city skyline, clad in crisp linen and wearing SG001 aviator sunglasses with slim metal frames and smoky teardrop lenses. Seamlessly transition from bright morning light through warm golden hour to neon-tinted evening, using a cohesive palette of high-contrast frames, gradient skies, sharp reflective surfaces and sleek lines.

On the left, an athletic model sprints on a sunlit track in neon performance wear, wearing SG004 “Sport” wraparound shield sunglasses with a single curved lens, reflective blue tint and rubberized grips that catch golden rays. In the center, a glamorous model poses on a vintage-inspired Hollywood terrace at dusk, dressed in sculpted acetate and wearing SG003 “Mystique” cat-eye sunglasses with upswept corners and jeweled temples in rose-gold. On the right, a minimalist model stands on a rooftop at sunset against a city skyline, clad in crisp linen and wearing SG001 aviator sunglasses with slim metal frames and smoky teardrop lenses. Seamlessly transition from bright morning light through warm golden hour to neon-tinted evening, using a cohesive palette of high-contrast frames, gradient skies, sharp reflective surfaces and sleek lines.

    "\n",
    "By completing this lab, you have seen how to:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **multi-agent LLM pipelines** to automate a creative workflow end-to-end.  \n",
    "- Combine **reasoning, tool-calling, and external data** to ground your outputs in reality.  \n",
    "- Apply multimodal models (like `gpt-4o`) that process **both text and images** for tasks such as generating campaign quotes.  \n",
    "- Extend the model’s abilities with tools (`tavily_search_tool`, `product_catalog_tool`) so your outputs are not only imaginative but also practical.  \n",
    "- Keep execution **transparent and debuggable** with structured logging and HTML-styled blocks.  \n",
    "- Deliver a polished, **executive-ready report** in Markdown format that blends insights, visuals, and justifications into a single artifact.  \n",
