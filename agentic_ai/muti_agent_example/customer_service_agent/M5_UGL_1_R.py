# ## 1. Introduction
# 
# As Andrew explained in the lecture, *planning with code execution* means letting the LLM **write code that becomes the plan itself**.  
# Compared to plain-text or JSON-based plans, this approach is more expressive and flexible: the code not only documents the steps but can also execute them directly.
# 
# In this lab, you will implement this design pattern in practice.  
# Instead of asking the LLM to output a plan in JSON format and then manually executing each step, we will allow it to **write Python code** that directly captures multiple steps of a plan. By executing this code, we can carry out complex queries automatically.  
# 
# To make things concrete, we simulate a **sunglasses store** with an **inventory** of products and a set of **transactions** (sales, returns, balance updates). This example shows how the LLM can generate code to query or update records, demonstrating the flexibility of this pattern.
# 
# ### 1.1 Lab Overview
# We will:
# 1. Create simple **inventory** and **transaction** datasets.  
# 2. Build a **schema block** describing the data.  
# 3. Prompt the LLM to **write a plan as Python code** (with comments explaining each step).  
# 4. Execute the code in a sandbox to obtain the answer.  
# 
# ### 1.2 Learning Outcomes
# 
# By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
# 
# - **Explain** why letting the model write code (instead of JSON or plain text plans) enables richer, more flexible planning.  
# - **Prompt** an LLM to produce Python code with step-by-step comments that both documents and executes the plan.  
# - **Run** the generated code safely in a sandbox and interpret the results.  
# 
# This illustrates how *Code as Action* can outperform brittle tool chains and JSON-based planning approaches.

from __future__ import annotations
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import OpenAI
import re, io, sys, traceback, json
from typing import Any, Dict, Optional
from tinydb import Query, where

# Utility modules
import utils      # helper functions for prompting/printing
import inv_utils  # functions for inventory, transactions, schema building, and TinyDB seeding

load_dotenv()
client = OpenAI()


# In the `inv_utils` module, we have functions like:
# 
# - `create_inventory()` – builds the sunglasses inventory.  
# - `create_transactions()` – builds the initial transaction log.  
# - `seed_db()` – loads both inventory and transactions into a JSON-backed store.  
# - `build_schema_block()` – generates a schema description used in the prompt.  
# - Helpers like `get_current_balance()` and `next_transaction_id()` – let the LLM handle consistent updates across inventory and transactions.  

# ### 2.1 Create Example Tables
# 
# We will now create two small tables for the sunglasses store simulation, using **[TinyDB](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/)** — a lightweight document-oriented database written in pure Python.  
# TinyDB stores data as JSON documents and is well-suited for small applications or prototypes, since it requires no server setup and allows you to query and update data easily.
# 
# The two tables are:
# 
# - **`inventory_tbl`**: contains product details such as name, item ID, description, quantity in stock, and price.  
# - **`transactions_tbl`**: starts with an opening balance and will later track purchases, returns, and adjustments.  
# 
# You will generate these tables using helper functions in `inv_utils`, and then preview the first few rows below.

# In[2]:


db, inventory_tbl, transactions_tbl = inv_utils.seed_db()


# Now, you can inspect the records in each table by printing them as formatted JSON:

# In[3]:


utils.print_html(json.dumps(inventory_tbl.all(), indent=2), title="Inventory Table")
utils.print_html(json.dumps(transactions_tbl.all(), indent=2), title="Transactions Table")


# As you can see above, the schemas of each table are as follows:
# 
# <div style="border:1px solid #BFDBFE; border-left:6px solid #3B82F6; background:#EFF6FF; border-radius:6px; padding:16px; font-family:system-ui,-apple-system,Segoe UI,Roboto,Ubuntu,Cantarell,Noto Sans,sans-serif; line-height:1.6; color:#1E3A8A;">
# 
#   <h4 style="margin-top:0; color:#1E40AF;">Inventory Table (<code>inventory_tbl</code>)</h4>
#   <ul>
#     <li><strong>item_id</strong> (string): Unique product identifier (e.g., SG001).</li>
#     <li><strong>name</strong> (string): Style of sunglasses (e.g., Aviator, Round).</li>
#     <li><strong>description</strong> (string): Text description of the product.</li>
#     <li><strong>quantity_in_stock</strong> (int): Current stock available.</li>
#     <li><strong>price</strong> (float): Price in USD.</li>
#   </ul>
#   <h4 style="margin-top:1em; color:#1E40AF;">Transactions Table (<code>transactions_tbl</code>)</h4>
#   <ul>
#     <li><strong>transaction_id</strong> (string): Unique identifier (e.g., TXN001).</li>
#     <li><strong>customer_name</strong> (string): Name of the customer, or <code>OPENING_BALANCE</code> for initial entry.</li>
#     <li><strong>transaction_summary</strong> (string): Short description of the transaction.</li>
#     <li><strong>transaction_amount</strong> (float): Amount of money for this transaction.</li>
#     <li><strong>balance_after_transaction</strong> (float): Running balance after applying the transaction.</li>
#     <li><strong>timestamp</strong> (string): ISO-8601 formatted date/time of the transaction.</li>
#   </ul>
# </div>
# 

# ## Planning with Code Execution

# ### 2.1. The plan
# 
# Once the schema is clear, you’ll build the **prompt** that instructs the model to *plan by writing code* and then execute that code. As Andrew emphasized, the code is the plan: the model explains each step in comments, then carries it out. Your prompt below also makes the model self-decide whether the request is read-only or a state change, and it enforces safe execution (no I/O, no network, TinyDB Query only, consistent mutations).
# 

# In[4]:


PROMPT = """You are a senior data assistant. PLAN BY WRITING PYTHON CODE USING TINYDB.

Database Schema & Samples (read-only):
{schema_block}

Execution Environment (already imported/provided):
- Variables: db, inventory_tbl, transactions_tbl  # TinyDB Table objects
- Helpers: get_current_balance(tbl) -> float, next_transaction_id(tbl, prefix="TXN") -> str
- Natural language: user_request: str  # the original user message

PLANNING RULES (critical):
- Derive ALL filters/parameters from user_request (shape/keywords, price ranges "under/over/between", stock mentions,
  quantities, buy/return intent). Do NOT hard-code values.
- Build TinyDB queries dynamically with Query(). If a constraint isn't in user_request, don't apply it.
- Be conservative: if intent is ambiguous, do read-only (DRY RUN).

TRANSACTION POLICY (hard):
- Do NOT create aggregated multi-item transactions.
- If the request contains multiple items, create a separate transaction row PER ITEM.
- For each item:
  - compute its own line total (unit_price * qty),
  - insert ONE transaction with that amount,
  - update balance sequentially (balance += line_total),
  - update the item’s stock.
- If any requested item lacks sufficient stock, do NOT mutate anything; reply with STATUS="insufficient_stock".

HUMAN RESPONSE REQUIREMENT (hard):
- You MUST set a variable named `answer_text` (type str) with a short, customer-friendly sentence (1–2 lines).
- This sentence is the only user-facing message. No dataframes/JSON, no boilerplate disclaimers.
- If nothing matches, politely say so and offer a nearby alternative (closest style/price) or a next step.

ACTION POLICY:
- If the request clearly asks to change state (buy/purchase/return/restock/adjust):
    ACTION="mutate"; SHOULD_MUTATE=True; perform the change and write a matching transaction row.
  Otherwise:
    ACTION="read"; SHOULD_MUTATE=False; simulate and explain briefly as a dry run (in logs only).

FAILURE & EDGE-CASE HANDLING (must implement):
- Do not capture outer variables in Query.test. Pass them as explicit args.
- Always set a short `answer_text`. Also set a string `STATUS` to one of:
  "success", "no_match", "insufficient_stock", "invalid_request", "unsupported_intent".
- no_match: No items satisfy the filters → suggest the closest in style/price, or invite a different range.
- insufficient_stock: Item found but stock < requested qty → state available qty and offer the max you can fulfill.
- invalid_request: Unable to parse essential info (e.g., quantity for a purchase/return) → ask for the missing piece succinctly.
- unsupported_intent: The action is outside the store’s capabilities → provide the nearest supported alternative.
- In all cases, keep the tone helpful and concise (1–2 sentences). Put technical details (e.g., ACTION/DRY RUN) only in stdout logs.

OUTPUT CONTRACT:
- Return ONLY executable Python between these tags (no extra text):
  <execute_python>
  # your python
  </execute_python>

CODE CHECKLIST (follow in code):
1) Parse intent & constraints from user_request (regex ok).
2) Build TinyDB condition incrementally; query inventory_tbl.
3) If mutate: validate stock, update inventory, insert a transaction (new id, amount, balance, timestamp).
4) ALWAYS set:
   - `answer_text` (human sentence, required),
   - `STATUS` (see list above).
   Also print a brief log to stdout, e.g., "LOG: ACTION=read DRY_RUN=True STATUS=no_match".
5) Optional: set `answer_rows` or `answer_json` if useful, but `answer_text` is mandatory.

TONE EXAMPLES (for `answer_text`):
- success: "Yes, we have our Classic sunglasses, a round frame, for $60."
- no_match: "We don’t have round frames under $100 in stock right now, but our Moon round frame is available at $120."
- insufficient_stock: "We only have 1 pair of Classic left; I can reserve that for you."
- invalid_request: "I can help with that—how many pairs would you like to purchase?"
- unsupported_intent: "We can’t refurbish frames, but I can suggest similar new models."

Constraints:
- Use TinyDB Query for filtering. Standard library imports only if needed.
- Keep code clear and commented with numbered steps.

# ### 2.2 From Prompt to Code (Planning in Code)
# 
# Let’s generate code that **is the plan**.
# 
# Instead of asking the model to output a plan in JSON and running it step-by-step with many tiny tools, let’s have it **write Python that encodes the whole plan** (e.g., “filter this, then compute that, then update this row”). The function `generate_llm_code`:
# 
# 1. **Builds a live schema** from `inventory_tbl` and `transactions_tbl` so the model sees real fields, types, and examples.
# 2. **Formats the prompt** with that schema plus the user’s question.
# 3. **Calls the model** to produce a **plan-with-code** response — typically an `<execute_python>...</execute_python>` block whose body contains the step-by-step logic.
# 4. **Returns the full response** (including the plan and the code).  
#    *We don’t execute anything in this step.*
# 
# Why this pattern? Let’s leverage Python/TinyDB as a rich toolbox the model already “knows,” so it can compose multi-step solutions directly in code instead of relying on a growing set of bespoke tools. We’ll extract and run the code in a later step.

# ### 2.3 Try a Sample Prompt (Planning-in-Code)
# 
# We’ll use the same prompt Andrew used in the lecture:
# 
# > **Prompt:** “Do you have any round sunglasses in stock that are under $100?”
# 
# Before generating any code, let’s manually inspect the TinyDB tables to see if there are truly *round* frames (word-only match) and what their prices look like. Run the next cell to preview the inventory and highlight items that match the word-only “round” filter.

# In[6]:


Item = Query()                    # Create a Query object to reference fields (e.g., Item.name, Item.description)

# Search the inventory table for documents where either the description OR the name
# contains the word "round" (case-insensitive). The check is done inline:
# - (v or "") ensures we handle None by converting it to an empty string
# - .lower() normalizes case
# - " round " enforces a crude word boundary (won't match "wraparound")
round_sunglasses = inventory_tbl.search(
    (Item.description.test(lambda v: " round " in ((v or "").lower()))) |
    (Item.name.test(        lambda v: " round " in ((v or "").lower())))
)

# Render the results as formatted JSON in the notebook UI
utils.print_html(json.dumps(round_sunglasses, indent=2), title="Inventory Status: Round Sunglasses")


# Great — we do have round frames available. From our manual inspection, there are two round styles in stock, but only **one** is **under \$100**. Therefore, the item that satisfies the requirement is:
# 
# ````python
# {
#   "item_id": "SG005",
#   "name": "Classic",
#   "description": "Classic round profile with minimalist metal frames, offering a timeless and versatile style that fits both casual and formal wear.",
#   "quantity_in_stock": 10,
#   "price": 60
# }
# ````
# 
# Now let’s ask the model to **generate a plan in code** that answers Andrew’s prompt (no execution yet).

# Inspect the LLM’s plan + code (no execution here)
utils.print_html(full_content_round, title="Plan with Code (Full Response)")


# ### 2.4. Define the executor function (run a given plan)
# 
# Now we’ll define the function that **takes a plan produced by the model and runs it** safely:
# 
# - It **accepts either** the full LLM response (with `<execute_python>…</execute_python>`) **or** raw Python code.
# - It **extracts** the executable block when needed.
# - It runs the code in a **controlled namespace** (TinyDB tables + safe helpers only).
# - It captures **stdout**, **errors**, and the model-set answer variables (`answer_text`, `answer_rows`, `answer_json`).
# - It renders **before/after** table snapshots to make side effects explicit.
# 
# This is the “executor” that turns a **plan-as-code** into actions and a concise user-facing answer.

# Use the `customer_service_agent(...)` helper to go from a natural-language request → plan-as-code → safe execution → before/after snapshots.
# 
# **Try these prompts:**
# 1) **Read-only (Andrew’s example):**  
#    “Do you have any round sunglasses in stock that are under $100?”
# 2) **Mutation — return:**  
#    “Return 2 Aviator sunglasses.”
# 3) **Mutation — purchase:**  
#    “Purchase 3 Wayfarer sunglasses for customer Alice.”
# 4) **Mutation - purchase multiple items:**
#    "I want to buy 3 pairs of classic sunglasses and 1 pair of aviator."

#   🔎 <strong>What does <code>reseed=True</code> do?</strong><br><br>
#   When you call <code>customer_service_agent(..., reseed=True)</code>, the agent <em>re-initializes</em> the demo data before running your prompt:
#   <ul style="margin:8px 0 0 18px;">
#     <li><strong>Resets</strong> the <code>inventory_tbl</code> to the default product set.</li>
#     <li><strong>Resets</strong> the <code>transactions_tbl</code> to a single opening-balance entry.</li>
#     <li>Ensures a <strong>clean, reproducible</strong> run so results aren’t affected by previous tests.</li>
#   </ul>
#   Set <code>reseed=False</code> if you want to <strong>preserve</strong> the current state and continue from prior operations.

prompt = "I want to buy 3 pairs of classic sunglasses and 1 pair of aviator sunglasses."

out = customer_service_agent(
    prompt,
    db=db,
    inventory_tbl=inventory_tbl,
    transactions_tbl=transactions_tbl,
    model="o4-mini",
    temperature=1.0,
    reseed=True,   # set False to keep current state of the inventory and the transactions
)


# ## 5. Takeaways
# 
# - **You let code be the plan.** Following Andrew’s “code-as-action” idea, you had the model write Python that chains the steps (filter → compute → update) and then you just ran it.
# 
# - **You skipped the brittle tool soup.** Instead of piling on tiny tools or JSON plans, you used Python/TinyDB—giving the model a big, familiar toolbox that handles many query shapes with one prompt.
# 
# - **You kept runs safe and visible.** You executed in a controlled namespace, captured logs/errors, and reviewed before/after tables—so you always know what changed and why.

# 
# 🎉 <strong>Congratulations!</strong>
# 
# You just finished the lab and built an <em>agentic</em> customer service workflow. You let the model write code as the plan, ran it safely, and used simple validations to keep updates reliable. When things failed, you surfaced clear, human-readable reasons; when things worked, you saw exactly what changed via before/after snapshots.
# 
# With this pattern—planning <em>in</em> code, plus transparent execution—you’re ready to design your own workflows that feel automatic, safe, and easy to extend. 🚀
