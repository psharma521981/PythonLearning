# # Graded Lab: Agentic Workflows
# 
# In this lab, you will build an agentic system that generates a short research report through planning, external tool usage, and feedback integration. Your workflow will involve:
# 
# ### Agents
# 
# * **Planning Agent / Writer**: Creates an outline and coordinates tasks.
# * **Research Agent**: Gathers external information using tools like Arxiv, Tavily, and Wikipedia.
# * **Editor Agent**: Reflects on the report and provides suggestions for improvement.

# <h4 style="color:green; font-weight:bold;">TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL GRADING OF YOUR ASSIGNMENT:</h4>
# 
# * All cells are frozen except for the ones where you need to write your solution code or when explicitly mentioned you can interact with it.
# 
# * In each exercise cell, look for comments `### START CODE HERE ###` and `### END CODE HERE ###`. These show you where to write the solution code. **Do not add or change any code that is outside these comments**.
# 
# * You can add new cells to experiment but these will be omitted by the grader, so don't rely on newly created cells to host your solution code, use the provided places for this.
# 
# * Avoid using global variables unless you absolutely have to. The grader tests your code in an isolated environment without running all cells from the top. As a result, global variables may be unavailable when scoring your submission. Global variables that are meant to be used will be defined in UPPERCASE.
# 
# * To submit your notebook for grading, first save it by clicking the 💾 icon on the top left of the page and then click on the <span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 3px 5px; font-size: 16px; border-radius: 5px;">Submit assignment</span> button on the top right of the page.

# 
# ### Research Tools
# 
# By importing `research_tools`, you gain access to several search utilities:
# 
# - `research_tools.arxiv_search_tool(query)` → search academic papers from **arXiv**  
# 
#   *Example:* `research_tools.arxiv_search_tool("neural networks for climate modeling")`
# 
# - `research_tools.tavily_search_tool(query)` → perform web searches with the **Tavily API**  
# 
#   *Example:* `research_tools.tavily_search_tool("latest trends in sunglasses fashion")`
# 
# - `research_tools.wikipedia_search_tool(query)` → retrieve summaries from **Wikipedia**  
# 
#   *Example:* `research_tools.wikipedia_search_tool("Ensemble Kalman Filter")`
# 
# Run the cell below to make them available.

CLIENT = Client()


# ## Exercise 1: planner_agent
# 
# ### Objective
# Correctly set up a call to a language model (LLM) to generate a research plan.
# 
# ### Instructions
# 
# 1. **Focus Areas**:
#    - Ensure `CLIENT.chat.completions.create` is correctly configured.
#    - Pass the `model` and `messages` parameters correctly:
#      - **Model**: Use `"openai:o4-mini"` by default.
#      - **Messages**: Set with `{"role": "user", "content": user_prompt}`.
#      - **Temperature**: Fixed at 1 for creative outputs.
# 
# ### Notes
# 
# - The prompt is pre-defined and guides the LLM on task requirements.
# - Only return a formatted list of steps — no extra text.
# 
# Focus on the LLM call setup to complete the task.

    You are a planning agent responsible for organizing a research workflow with multiple intelligent agents.

    🧠 Available agents:
    - A research agent who can search the web, Wikipedia, and arXiv.
    - A writer agent who can draft research summaries.
    - An editor agent who can reflect and revise the drafts.

    🎯 Your job is to write a clear, step-by-step research plan **as a valid Python list**, where each step is a string.
    Each step should be atomic, executable, and must rely only on the capabilities of the above agents.

    🚫 DO NOT include irrelevant tasks like "create CSV", "set up a repo", "install packages", etc.
    ✅ DO include real research-related tasks (e.g., search, summarize, draft, revise).
    ✅ DO assume tool use is available.
    ✅ DO NOT include explanation text — return ONLY the Python list.
    ✅ The final step should be to generate a Markdown document containing the complete research report.

# ## Exercise 2: research_agent
# 
# ### Objective
# Set up a call to a language model (LLM) to perform a research task using various tools.
# 
# ### Instructions
# 
# **Focus Areas**:
# 
# - **Creating a Custom Prompt**:
#   - **Define the Role**: Clearly specify the role, such as "research assistant."
#   - **List Available Tools** (as strings inside the prompt, not the actual functions):
#     - Use `arxiv_tool` to find academic papers.
#     - Use `tavily_tool` for general web searches.
#     - Use `wikipedia_tool` for accessing encyclopedic knowledge.
#   - **Specify the Task**: Include a placeholder in your prompt for defining the specific task that needs to be accomplished.
#   - **Include Date Information**: Add a placeholder for the current date or time to provide context.
# 
# - **Creating Messages Dict**:
#   - Ensure the `messages` are correctly set with `{"role": "user", "content": prompt}`.
# 
# - **Creating Tools List**:
#   - Create a list of tools for use, such as `research_tools.arxiv_search_tool`, `research_tools.tavily_search_tool`, and `research_tools.wikipedia_search_tool`.
# 
# - **Correctly Setting the Call to the LLM**:
#   - Pass the `model`, `messages`, and `tools` parameters accurately.
#   - Set `tool_choice` to `"auto"` for automatic tool selection.
#   - Limit interactions with `max_turns=6`.
# 
# ### Notes
# 
# - The function provides pre-coded blocks where you need to replace placeholder values.
# - The approach allows the LLM to use tools dynamically based on the task.
# 
# Focus on accurately setting the messages, tools, and LLM call parameters to complete the task.

# Set up a call to a language model (LLM) for executing writing tasks like drafting, expanding, or summarizing text.

#      - Define `system_prompt` to assign the LLM the role of a writing agent focused on generating academic or technical content.
#    - **System and User Messages**:

# ### 🎯 The Executor Agent
# 
# The `executor_agent` manages the workflow by executing each step of a given plan. It:
# 
# 1. Decides **which agent** (`research_agent`, `writer_agent`, or `editor_agent`) should handle the step.
# 2. Builds context from the outputs of previous steps.
# 3. Sends the enriched task to the selected agent.
# 4. Collects and stores the results in a shared history.
# 
# 👉 **Do not implement or modify this function.** It is already provided as the orchestration component of the multi-agent pipeline.
# 
# Notice that `planner_agent` might return a long list of steps. Because of this, the maximum number of steps is set to a maximum of 4 to keep running time reasonable.
