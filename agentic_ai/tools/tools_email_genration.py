# # M3 Agentic AI - Email assistant workflow
# 
# ## 1. Introduction
# 
# ### 1.1 Lab overview
# 
# In an earlier video in this module, Andrew showed the example of a calendar assistant that could use multiple tools to carry out complex tasks. In this ungraded lab, you’ll explore a similar example - working with an **email assistant agent**. 
# 
# This agentic workflow can carry out various tasks related to email management, including sending emails, searching for emails from a specific sender, and deleting emails. You’ll give it natural language instructions - like “check unread emails from my boss” or “delete the Happy Hour email” - and see how it selects the right tools and completes the task for you.
#

# 
# ### 🎯 1.2 Learning outcome
# By the end of this lab, you will be able to **connect an LLM to tools** with AISuite, give natural language instructions, and observe how the agent selects, executes, and validates multi-step tasks such as searching, sending, and deleting emails.
# 

# ## 2. Initialize environment and client
# 
# As in previous lab, you will now set up the environment.  

# In[1]:


# ================================
# Imports
# ================================

# --- Third-party ---
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import aisuite as ai
import json

# --- Local / project ---
import utils
import display_functions
import email_tools



# ================================
# Environment & Client
# ================================
load_dotenv()          # Load environment variables from .env
client = ai.Client()   # Initialize AISuite client


# ## 3. Simulated email service
# 
# ### 3.1 Components
# This lab uses a **simulated email backend** to mimic real-world email interactions.
# Think of it as your personal sandbox email inbox: it comes preloaded with messages so you can practice without sending real emails.  
# 
# Instead of building this backend from scratch, you’ll be using tools that let you interact with it directly. Behind the scenes, it uses:
# 
# | Layer                   | Purpose                        |
# |-------------------------|--------------------------------|
# | **FastAPI**             | Exposes REST endpoints         |
# | **SQLite + SQLAlchemy** | Stores and queries emails locally |
# | **Pydantic**            | Ensures inputs and outputs are valid |
# | **AISuite tools**       | Bridge between the LLM and the service |
# 
# 
# ### 3.2 Endpoints
# The service provides several routes that simulate common email actions.  
# Later on, these will be wrapped as tools so the assistant can use them automatically:
# 
# - `POST /send` → send a new email  
# - `GET /emails` → list all emails  
# - `GET /emails/unread` → show only unread emails  
# - `GET /emails/{id}` → fetch a specific email by ID  
# - `GET /emails/search?q=...` → search emails by keyword  
# - `GET /emails/filter` → filter by recipient or date range  
# - `PATCH /emails/{id}/read` → mark an email as read  
# - `PATCH /emails/{id}/unread` → mark an email as unread  
# - `DELETE /emails/{id}` → delete an email by ID  
# - `GET /reset_database` → reset emails to initial state (for testing)  
# 
# 
# > 💡 **Key idea:** These endpoints act as the “inbox controls.”  
# > In the next steps, you’ll expose them as Python functions (tools) that the LLM can call—turning raw routes into agent actions.
# 
# ### 3.3 Endpoint test helpers
# Before giving control to the LLM, you’ll first **test the backend yourself**.  
# The `utils.test_*` functions are quick wrappers around the API endpoints. They let you try actions like **send, list, search, filter, mark, and delete** without writing raw HTTP requests.
# 
# _**Note:** find the utils.py file from the top menu by navigating to File > Open_
# 
# Each helper has a clear, self-explanatory name. In the next cell code, you can uncomment the one you want to run, check their output, and confirm that the email service behaves as expected.  
# 
# For example, you can test:  
# - Send a test email  
# - Fetch email by ID  
# - List all messages  
# - Mark email as read or unread  
# - Delete email  
# 
# This step is your **sanity check** before handing the controls over to the agent. It gives you confidence that the simulated email service is alive and behaving just like a real email service would.
# 
# 👉 To test the endpoints, **uncomment** the lines you’d like to try out, run the cell, and check the results instantly.

# In[2]:


# uncomment the line 'utils.test_*' you want to try
new_email_id = utils.test_send_email()
_ = utils.test_get_email(new_email_id['id'])
#_ = utils.test_list_emails()
#_ = utils.test_filter_emails(recipient="test@example.com")
#_ = utils.test_search_emails("lunch")
#_ = utils.test_unread_emails()
#_ = utils.test_mark_read(new_email_id['id'])
#_ = utils.test_mark_unread(new_email_id['id'])
#_ = utils.test_delete_email(new_email_id['id'])
#_ = utils.reset_database()


# ## 4. Tool layer for the email agent
# 
# ### 4.1 Why tools?
# Now that the endpoints are working, the next step is to expose them to the LLM as Python functions called **tools**. Each tool wraps a REST route, transforming raw API calls into actions the agent can perform—like list, read, search, send, delete, or toggle read.
# 
# > Think of tools as the agent’s **actuators**: you give a natural language instruction (“check unread emails from my boss and send a polite reply”), and the model chooses **which tools** to call and **in what order** to complete the task.
# 
# ### 4.2 Design hints
# - Keep tool **docstrings** short, imperative, and specific to the action.  
# - Return **consistent, compact JSON** so the model can chain results.  
# - Prefer **one clear responsibility per tool** (single route, single effect).
# 
# ### 4.3 Available tools
# | Tool Function                      | Action                                                                 |
# |------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
# | `list_all_emails()`                | Fetch all emails, newest first                                         |
# | `list_unread_emails()`             | Retrieve only unread emails                                            |
# | `search_emails(query)`             | Search by keyword in subject, body, or sender                          |
# | `filter_emails(...)`               | Filter by recipient and/or date range                                  |
# | `get_email(email_id)`              | Fetch a specific email by ID                                           |
# | `mark_email_as_read(id)`           | Mark an email as read                                                  |
# | `mark_email_as_unread(id)`         | Mark an email as unread                                                |
# | `send_email(...)`                  | Send a new (simulated) email                                                |
# | `delete_email(id)`                 | Delete an email by ID                                                  |
# | `search_unread_from_sender(addr)`  | Return unread emails from a given sender (e.g., `boss@email.com`)      |
# 
# **Note:** find the email_tools.py file from the top menu by navigating to File > Open.
# 
# For example, **testing `list_all_emails()` tool:**
# ```python
#     all_emails = email_tools.list_all_emails()
# ```
# 
# Now, let’s try out a few tools that connect to the simulated endpoints to make sure everything is working. 
# 
# 👉 **Uncomment** the ones you’d like to run, execute the cell, and review the outputs.

# In[3]:


# Test sending a new email and fetch it by ID
new_email = email_tools.send_email("test@example.com", "Lunch plans", "Shall we meet at noon?")
content_ = email_tools.get_email(new_email['id'])

# Uncomment the ones you want to try:
#content_ = email_tools.list_all_emails()
#content_ = email_tools.list_unread_emails()
#content_ = email_tools.search_emails("lunch")
#content_ = email_tools.filter_emails(recipient="test@example.com")
#content_ = email_tools.mark_email_as_read(new_email['id'])
#content_ = email_tools.mark_email_as_unread(new_email['id'])
#content_ = email_tools.search_unread_from_sender("test@example.com")
#content_ = email_tools.delete_email(new_email['id'])

utils.print_html(content=json.dumps(content_, indent=2), title="Testing the email_tools")


# ## 5. Preparing the agent prompt
# 
# Before assigning tasks to the email assistant agent, you’ll create a small helper function called `build_prompt()`. 
# This function wraps the natural language request in a system-style preamble so the LLM:
# 
# - Recognizes that it’s acting as an **email assistant agent**  
# - Understands it has permission to use the available tools  
# - Executes actions directly, without asking for confirmation (no human-in-the-loop)

# In[4]:


def build_prompt(request_: str) -> str:
    return f"""
- You are an AI assistant specialized in managing emails.
- You can perform various actions such as listing, searching, filtering, and manipulating emails.
- Use the provided tools to interact with the email system.
- Never ask the user for confirmation before performing an action.
- If needed, my email address is "you@email.com" so you can use it to send emails or perform actions related to my account.

{request_.strip()}
"""


# Run the next cell to see how the previous function **wraps your raw user prompt** with system instructions.
# For example:

# In[5]:


example_prompt = build_prompt("Delete the Happy Hour email")
utils.print_html(content=example_prompt, title="Example example_prompt")


# ### 5.3 Resetting the email service
# 
# Since you’ve been experimenting with the email service, let’s reset it back to its initial state.
# 
# You can do this by calling the utility function that clears and refreshes the simulated email service:

# In[6]:


utils.reset_database()


# ## 6. LLM + Email tools
# 
# ### 6.1 Scenario
# So far, you’ve been working directly with the backend. Now it’s time to let the **LLM take control** as your email assistant agent.
# 
# For example, you might ask it:
# > “Check for unread emails from `boss@email.com`, mark them as read, and send a polite follow-up.”
# 
# ### 6.2 What happen
# 1. The agent interprets your instruction.  
# 2. It selects the right tools (`search_unread_from_sender` → `mark_email_as_read` → `send_email`).  
# 3. It executes each action automatically, without asking for confirmation.
# 
# AISuite handles schema exposure, argument binding, execution, and passing results between steps—so you can focus on **what** the agent achieves, not **how** to call the API.
# 
# ### 6.3 Run it
# Run the next cell and see how the agent orchestrates multiple tools to fulfill your request. Feel free to try your own requests with the email service as well.
# 
# *What to look for:*
# - A clear **tool-call trace** showing which tools were used and the arguments passed.
# - A concise **final message** summarizing the actions performed (e.g., “Found 1 unread email, marked as read, sent follow-up”).

# In[7]:


# Try your own requests
prompt_ = build_prompt("Check for unread emails from boss@email.com, mark them as read, and send a polite follow-up.")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai:gpt-4.1", # LLM

        email_tools.send_email
    ],
    max_turns=5,
)

display_functions.pretty_print_chat_completion(response)



# ### 6.4. Missing tool: `delete_email`
# 
# What happens if the tool you need isn’t available?  
# 
# For example, try this request:  
# > “Delete alice@work.com’s email.”
# 
# Since the `delete_email` tool is not registered, the LLM will still attempt to respond, but it won’t be able to complete the action.

# #### 6.4.1 Try again with `delete_email` enabled
# 
# What happens if the tool you need isn’t available?
# 
# In the previous step of the lab, you gave the LLM access to the following list of tools:
# ```python
#     tools=[
#         email_tools.search_unread_from_sender,
#         email_tools.list_unread_emails,
#         email_tools.search_emails,
#         email_tools.get_email,
#         email_tools.mark_email_as_read,
#         email_tools.send_email
#     ]
# ```
# 
# And because of the tools available in that list, the agent couldn’t delete emails because the `delete_email` tool wasn’t available.
# 
# Now add `delete_email` to the tool list and re-run the cell. This time, the agent has everything it needs to finish the task.  
# 
# > Tip: Watch the sequence of calls — after finding the target message, the agent should select `delete_email` to complete the action.

# ### 6.5. Targeted action: Delete the “Happy Hour” email
# 
# The test inbox comes preloaded with a message titled **“Happy Hour.”**  Your task is to instruct the agent to locate this message and delete it.

# ## 7. Final Takeaways
# 
# - In this ungraded lab, **you explored** how an LLM email agent interacts with a simulated email service using tool calls.
# - **Tool calling** allows LLMs to go beyond text generation—enabling them to call functions (tools) and complete multi-step tasks.
# - The set of available tools determines what the agent can and cannot do (e.g., without `delete_email`, it cannot remove messages).
# - Clear docstrings and consistent behavior help the LLM select the right tool for each step.
# - AISuite manages the interaction layer: exposing Python functions as tools, accepting parameters, making API requests, and returning results.
# - Observing the full workflow—from prompt → tool calls → outputs → final response—is key to understanding and improving how agents reason and act.

# 
# 🎉 <strong>Congratulations!</strong>
# 
# You just guided an LLM-powered <em>email assistant agent</em> from natural language requests to concrete actions on a simulated email service. You saw how tools turn plain language into reliable operations—listing, searching, marking as read, sending, and deleting—without you touching raw HTTP requests. 
# 
# You learned that the tools you expose define the agent’s real capabilities. When a tool is missing, the agent can reason but cannot act; when it’s present, it can chain steps, pass parameters, and deliver exactly what you asked for. Along the way, AISuite handled the plumbing: schema exposure, argument binding, execution, and result passing—so you could focus on what you wanted done, not how to wire it up.
# 
# With this workflow under your belt, you’re ready to design task-focused agents that act safely and transparently, explain what they did, and scale from simple prompts to dependable multi-step automation across your own services. 🌟
