    "# Graded Lab : Tool Use and Reflective Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore how AI agents can enhance research workflows by leveraging external tools and engaging in critical self-reflection. You'll learn how to build and integrate callable tools—such as web and academic search functions, and connect them to a language model using OpenAI's tool-calling API. Then, you’ll guide the agent to not only generate content but also **reflect** on its own output, improving the quality and depth of the final report. By the end of this lab, you will have implemented a mini agent capable of searching, reasoning, and publishing structured reports in HTML—laying the foundation for more advanced multi-step and autonomous AI systems."

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique in Generative AI where additional context is retrieved from external sources to enrich the generative process of Large Language Models (LLMs). In traditional RAG approaches, a basic framework is employed to retrieve documents that enrich the context of an LLM prompt. 5. **Retrieve relevant data:** Search the vector database for embeddings that closely match the query’s embedding based on semantic similarity. * Pathway AI Pipelines: A production-ready RAG framework supporting real-time indexing, retrieval, and change tracking across diverse data sources. These metrics are used to measure the similarity between embeddings, which is crucial for evaluating how effectively RAG systems retrieve and integrate external documents or data sources. The list below features several database systems suitable for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. They cover a range of RAG use cases, aiding in the efficient storage and retrieval of vectors to generate responses or recommendations.', 'url': 'https://github.com/Danielskry/Awesome-RAG'}\n",

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a hybrid AI framework that bolsters large language models (LLMs) by combining them with external, up-to-date data sources. Instead of relying solely on static training data, RAG retrieves relevant documents at query time and feeds them into the model as context. This process flow helps developers update data sources without retraining the model and makes RAG a scalable and cost-effective solution for building LLM applications in domains like customer support, knowledge bases and internal search. This is called retrieval augmented generation (RAG), as you would retrieve the relevant data and use it as augmented context for the LLM. With RAG architecture, organizations can deploy any LLM model and augment it to return relevant results for their organization by giving it a small amount of their data without the costs and time of fine-tuning or pretraining the model.', 'url': 'https://www.databricks.com/glossary/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag'}\n",

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response. It redirects the LLM to retrieve relevant information from authoritative, pre-determined knowledge sources. Developers can also restrict sensitive information retrieval to different authorization levels and ensure the LLM generates appropriate responses. Without RAG, the LLM takes the user input and creates a response based on information it was trained on—or what it already knows. With RAG, an information retrieval component is introduced that utilizes the user input to first pull information from a new data source. Next, the RAG model augments the user input (or prompts) by adding the relevant retrieved data in context. Semantic search enhances RAG results for organizations wanting to add vast external knowledge sources to their LLM applications.', 'url': 'https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/'}\n",

      "## Key Findings from Recent Studies\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **V3890 Sagittarii: A Case Study of Emission Across Wavelengths**\n",
      "A detailed review of the recurrent nova V3890 Sagittarii was presented which discussed its third eruption in August 2019. The observations spanned from gamma-rays to radio wavelengths (1 GHz observations with MeerKAT). Notably, shock-powered emissions were highlighted as a significant feature, shedding light on ejecta morphology and the circumstellar environment of the binary system. The study also combined radio imaging with optical spectra measurements to estimate the distance to the nova (PoS - The recurrent nova V3890 Sgr - https://pos.sissa.it/460/037).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Radio Observations of RS Ophiuchi**\n",
      "Low-frequency radio observations of the 2021 outburst of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi were reported, revealing synchrotron emission due to the shock interaction between nova ejecta and the circumbinary medium. This research suggested that the radio emissions could potentially persist between outbursts, enhancing our understanding of the long-term radio behavior of such systems (Low-frequency radio observations of RS Ophiuchi - https://inspirehep.net/literature/2626516).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Insights from Synchrotron Emission Modeling**\n",
      "Observations of V745 Scorpii and RS Ophiuchi at 610 and 235 MHz using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope offered insights into their evolution. These studies applied synchrotron emission models to the light curves and indicated changes in the visibility of radio emissions after outbursts, suggesting a connection to local absorbing gas (Insights into the evolution of symbiotic recurrent novae - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.456L..49K).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **First Radio Detection of a Recurrent Nova Outburst**\n",
      "The initial detection of radio signals during an outburst from RS Ophiuchi was reported, marking a significant first in the field. The brightness temperature observed during this event greatly exceeded typical values, indicating a non-thermal origin for the radio emissions and suggesting a change in the emission mechanism compared to classical novae (First radio detection of a recurrent nova outburst - https://www.nature.com/articles/315306a0).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Double-Peaked Radio Light Curves**\n",
      "A recent study presented observations of V3890 Sagitarii following its 2019 eruption, emphasizing the synchrotron emission that dominated its radio light curves over a wide temporal range. This study utilized advanced radio telescopes to indicate that the emissions were mainly produced from the expanding ejecta interacting with wind from an evolved companion star (Synchrotron emission from double-peaked radio light curves - https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09116).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Radio observations are proving indispensable to the study of recurrent novae, not only by providing direct insights into their emissions and outburst mechanics but also by allowing for the assessment of their environments over time. As observational techniques improve and new data becomes available, our understanding of these complex astrophysical phenomena is bound to deepen further.\n",

      "The draft report on radio observations of recurrent novae presents a well-structured overview of recent findings in the field. The strengths of the report include its clear organization into sections, each highlighting significant studies and their contributions to our understanding of recurrent novae. The use of specific case studies, such as V3890 Sagittarii and RS Ophiuchi, effectively illustrates the application of radio observations in astrophysics. However, there are limitations in terms of depth; while the report summarizes key findings, it could benefit from a more critical analysis of the implications of these findings or a discussion of potential limitations in the studies cited. Additionally, the report could improve clarity by providing more context for readers unfamiliar with specific terms or concepts, such as 'synchrotron emission' or 'brightness temperature.' Suggestions for improvement include incorporating a brief explanation of these terms and their relevance to the studies discussed. The academic tone is generally appropriate, but some sentences could be rephrased for greater formality and precision. Opportunities for enhancement include discussing future research directions or unanswered questions in the field, which would provide a more comprehensive view of the topic. Overall, the report serves as a solid foundation but would benefit from deeper analysis and clarity in certain areas. \n",
